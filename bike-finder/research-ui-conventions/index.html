Four items:

- Click the shopping cart
- Proceed to checkout -> lead to new customer vs. login page 
- Proceed as a new customer
- Shipping information, Billing information -> different pages
- Finalize the order



What elements or patterns seem universal?
- Checkout page is very consistent (order summary on the right, steps are the same -> shipping address, billing address, finalize the order(check the item for the last)
- Shopping cart always on the top right corner
- Nav bar on the top (very close to the search bar)
- Filters for categories/search results always on left side of the page
- Logos on top left of page (always)
- original item price is always displayed close to savings/discount if there is one
- item shows picture, then title, then price

- Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?
- Amazon -> titles of items are very long (with no hierarchy details listed in the preview), making it difficult to find certain speculations amongst a large page of results
- Harley -> high contrast color from the background and to the loading page (loading page disrupted the flow)
- Bestbuy -> have filters on the left but also a broad categories with images across the top, below navigation bar, that was more accessible

What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?
- Harley Davidson and Nike included sizes and colors for each one of their items, while amazon and Best Buy do not immediately highlight these things
- Seeing clothing items from different perspectives was important for me, but we didn't need that for masks or even really the electric scooter


Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?
- One thing that made Best Buy stand out was how easy it was to search by category, despite them having a pretty decent variety of products
- The most popular and sought after tech items were clearly kept track of, and the site was organized accordingly

Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?
- I was most comfortable on the nike site, as the black and water color scheme really helped make the products stand out (i could focus on them better)
- but I felt most disrupted on the Harley Davidson site, especially when it loaded between pages and the screen turned to this scratchy black background
