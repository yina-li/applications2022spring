The physical product (materials, options, specifications)
- Essential Bicycle Parts (quoted from Momentum mag)
    Pedal: This is the part that a cyclist places their feet on. The pedal is attached to the crank which is the component that the cyclist rotates to spin the chain which in turn provides the bicycle’s power.

    Front derailleur: Mechanism for changing the front gears by lifting the chain from one chain wheel to another; it allows the cyclist to adapt to road conditions.

    Chain (or drive chain): Set of metal links meshing with the sprockets on the chain wheel and gear wheel to transmit the pedaling motion to the rear wheel.

    Chain stay: Tube connecting the pedal and crank mechanism to the rear-wheel hub.

    Rear derailleur: Mechanism for changing the rear gears by lifting the chain from one gear wheel to another; it allows the cyclist to adapt to road conditions.

    Rear brake: Mechanism activated by a brake cable, comprising a caliper and return springs; it forces a pair of brake pads against the sidewalls to stop the bicycle.

    Seat tube: Part of the frame leaning slightly to the rear, receiving the seat post and joining the pedal mechanism.

    Seat stay: Tube connecting the top of the seat tube with the rear-wheel hub.

    Seat post: Component supporting and attaching the seat, inserted to variable depth into the seat tube to adjust the seat’s height.

    Seat: Small triangular seat attached to the bicycle’s frame.

    Crossbar: Horizontal part of the frame, connecting the head tube with the seat tube and stabilizing the frame.

    Down tube: Part of the frame connecting the head tube to the pedal mechanism; it is the longest and thickest tube in the frame and gives it its rigidity.

    Tire valve: Small clack valve sealing the inflation opening of the inner tube; it allows air to enter but prevents it from escaping.

    Spoke: Thin metal spindle connecting the hub to the rim.

    Tire: Structure made of cotton and steel fibers coated with rubber, mounted on the rim to form the casing for the inner tube.

    Rim: Metal circle constituting the wheel’s circumference and on which the tire is mounted.

    Hub: Central part of the wheel from which spokes radiate. Inside the hub are ball bearings enabling it to rotate around its axle.

    Fork: Two tubes connected to the head tube and attached to each end of the front-wheel hub.

    Front brake: Mechanism activated by a brake cable, comprising a caliper and return springs; it forces a pair of brake pads against the sidewalls to slow down the front wheel.  

    Brake lever: Lever attached to the handlebars for activating the brake caliper via a cable.

    Head tube: Tube using ball bearings to transmit the steering movement to the fork.

    Stem: Part whose height is adjustable; it is inserted into the head tube and supports the handlebars.

    Handlebars: Device made up of two handles connected by a tube, for steering the bicycle.

    Brake cable: Sheathed steel cable transmitting the pressure exerted on the brake lever to the brake.

    Shifter: Lever for changing gears via a cable moving the derailleur.
